- Features used:
  - Pclass
  - Sex
  - Age
  - SibSp
  - Parch
  - Fare
  - Embarked

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split the dataset into training/testing sets
- Trained a Random Forest model
- Evaluated performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score

# Results
