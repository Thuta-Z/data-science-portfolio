# Coursework Practice – Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

This is a **coursework practice notebook** from my Computer Engineering studies.  
It demonstrates how to use a **pretrained Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50-FPN)** model from TorchVision for **object detection**.

## What I practiced
- Loading a **pretrained model** for inference
- Preprocessing images (TorchVision + PIL)
- Running predictions and filtering by confidence threshold
- Visualizing bounding boxes, labels, and scores (OpenCV + Matplotlib)

## Notes
- The model is **not trained here**. It uses TorchVision’s pretrained weights on the COCO dataset.
- Images are sample downloads (used only for testing the inference).
- Purpose: **practice and understanding of inference workflows**, not a final project.
